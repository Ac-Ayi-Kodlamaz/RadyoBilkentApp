# BilkentRadyo
This is a mobile app for our CS102 project

The app will include an apk file that will be an installable application for android users to both listen to radio bilkent online and possibly vote for the upoming music if Bilkent Radio ever cares about out project.
It will also have a desktop UI that is made to reach all of the data in the database and set things like the podcasts, blogs and voting sessions via the Admin Account.

This means that normal users will access the application through an android app and by creating an account and the admin will access it through the Admin Panel UI made for the desktop through their admin accounts.
